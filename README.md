For my SBA # 2 I had to create, design, and develop a responsive, multi-section webpage for a fictitiounal company called Accessible Design Co. I created my webpage using both HTML and CSS elements along with accessibility.
"The name of the webpage is Accessible Design Co" it is a very basic webpage with common functions a website should have
The site has symantic HTML structure, flex boxes, and grids. All of these were used to make things such as the navigation bar. 
My webpage gas ARIA incorporated in it because it should be "ACCESSIBLE" to all!! * badoon ting!! * lol but seriously, It is added to benefit those that may have disabilities.
This project is mostly css and less html.

That about summarizes my work. :)
